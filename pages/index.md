Hello, world this is Carter Snook, the creator of CodingCarter and I would like to introduce you to the wonderful world of programming.  I build this website because I would *love* to teach others how to create amazing applications with *only* code!  Programming is not something that you have to be smart to be able to do.  It is something that one has to only try to do.  I am fifteen years old currently while typing this text right now on 12/29/2019.  I built this website using <a href='https://saber.land'>Saber</a>, a static site generator.  My journey through the world of 0s and 1s has benifited me more than I will ever know!  Now, join me on this adventure, and reap the benefits of knowledge!

> Good Luck, Carter Snook
