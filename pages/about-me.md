I am a fifteen year old programmer who is currently a freshman in high school.  I am going to be taking the AP Computer Science A test in May that will give me College Credit if I get above a 3.  The test will basically be on the Java programming language.  I have been coding for around 3 years but I have developed the most in the last couple of months.  I have obtained my current skills from watching YouTube videos and Udemy courses.  I hope to someday create my own courses on one of the video platforms.  I am excited to teach others through this blog, though!
